\section{Projects}
\cvitem{Automatic Speech Recognition at NTT}{Research Scientist}
\cvlistitem{This project aims to research and develop automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems at NTT.}
\cvlistitem{My research interest includes various extensions for acoustic models and end-to-end models in ASR, for example, noise robust ASR~\cite{Karita2017}, far-field ASR~\cite{Yoshioka2015}, sequential training~\cite{karita_icassp2018}, semi-supervised training~\cite{Karita_interspeech2018,karita_icassp2019}.\newline}

\cvitem{ESPnet: end-to-end speech processing toolkit}{Core Developer} % {\url{https://github.com/espnet/espnet}}
\cvlistitem{This project aims to be an open source state-of-the-art platform for end-to-end speech processing~\cite{Watanabe2018}.}
\cvlistitem{I mainly develop and maintain ASR and TTS pytorch backend, and continuous integration (CI) for unittesting and sphinx documentation. For example, my early PR made ESPnet 3-4 times faster. \url{https://github.com/espnet/espnet/pull/17}}
% As my weekend projects at GitHub, I have developed various machine learning frameworks, e.g., GPU-based autograd tensor library, SVM, decision trees.
